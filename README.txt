simple banking system version 1.3

Improvements:
Here are a few recommendations to make the code more clean:

Separate SQL queries from Java code:

Consider moving the SQL queries to a separate SQL file or a constants class, so that they are not mixed with Java code.
Use logger instead of System.out.println:

Instead of using System.out.println to log exceptions, consider using a logging framework like Log4j or Java's built-in
logging framework.nUse try-with-resources statement for Connection, Statement, and ResultSet:

Use the try-with-resources statement to automatically close the Connection, Statement,
and ResultSet objects after the try block finishes.
Use more descriptive variable names:

Consider using more descriptive variable names instead of single-letter names like a, sqe, conn, res, etc.
Use constants instead of hardcoding values:

Use constants instead of hardcoding values like DB_URL, tableSQL, insertSQL, and findSQL.
Consider using a DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern:

Consider using a DAO design pattern to separate the database access code from the business logic code.
Use consistent naming conventions:

Use consistent naming conventions throughout the code, for example, using camelCase for method names.
Consider using dependency injection:

Consider using dependency injection to inject the database connection into the BankDatabase class,
instead of creating it inside the class. This can make the code more modular and easier to test.
These are just a few suggestions to make the code more clean. There may be other improvements that can be made depending
 on the specific requirements and context of the project.
